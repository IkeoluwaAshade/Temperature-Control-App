### `How the Temperature App Works`
So basically this Temperature App has a range of Temperature between -5째C to 50째C. Once the temperature is below 15째C the color becomes skyBlue which means the temperature is cold. And when the temperature reaches 15째C the color changes to OrangeRed which symbolizes Hotness
